// Builds the app's detailed vehicle models (assets/*.glb) from published 3D models that may be used freely:
//   - NASA 3D Resources (https://github.com/nasa/NASA-3D-Resources), free and without copyright (see NASA's usage
//     guidelines);
//   - models on Sketchfab under CC0 (public domain) or CC BY 4.0 (credit the author: README.md and the app's credits).
//     Sketchfab asks for a sign-in to download, so these are fetched by hand: each recipe names the model's page; download
//     the glTF version and unzip it into a folder of its own under the --dl directory.
//
// Each recipe below
//   - splits a model into the parts the app moves on their own (a lunar module's ascent and descent stages, a rover's
//     wheels, an orbiter's payload bay doors …): one node per part, holding a child node with the part's mesh, so the
//     part's own transform stays free for the app (a wheel turns about its pivot) while the mesh node carries meshopt's
//     dequantisation;
//   - scales it to metres and puts each part's origin where the app's own model of that part has it, so the parts
//     drop into every configuration (docked, landed, lifting off) unchanged;
//   - drops parts too small to ever see, merges meshes by material (a few draw calls per part) and simplifies them;
//   - sets metalness and roughness where the source materials are converted Blinn, strips material extensions the app
//     does not need (transmission would cost three.js a second render pass), shrinks textures to WebP;
//   - quantises and compresses the geometry with meshopt (EXT_meshopt_compression, decoded by three.js's MeshoptDecoder).
